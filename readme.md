# SQL AI Agent

## üöÄ Project Overview
This project is an AI-powered chatbot that assists users in interacting with an SQL database using natural language. The goal is to allow users to write requests in plain English, and the AI agent will generate the corresponding SQL queries. Users can then review, modify, and execute the queries, making database operations more intuitive and accessible.

### Key Features:
- Converts natural language queries into SQL queries.
- Allows users to edit generated queries before execution.
- Supports SQL operations like data retrieval, updates, view creation, and stored procedures.
- Six predefined sample questions available on the welcome screen.
- Smart prompt engineering ensures appropriate chatbot responses.
- Uses OpenAI, Flask, Python, and JavaScript.
- Includes a detailed logging system, structured repo, and config files.
- Provides a media folder containing architecture diagrams and UI screenshots.
- Utilizes OpenAI streaming for word-by-word chatbot responses.
- Saves chat history with session storage and an interactive sidebar.
- Sidebar includes individual session deletion and a "Clear All" option.
- Uses icons from [Lucide.dev](http://lucide.dev/) for aesthetics.
